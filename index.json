In 2016, China consolidated its urban and rural resident social health insurance programs into one program with a goal to reduce disparities between rural and urban populations. Using a nationally-representative sample of 14,967 individuals from the China Family Panel Studies surveys (2012–2018), we investigate whether the consolidation reduced gaps in total and out-of-pocket medical expenditure, and reimbursement between rural and urban residents. Our identification approach relies on an augmented difference-in-differences analysis whereby we compare the two programs that were consolidated to a different program that was not consolidated, before and after the consolidation. We find no evidence that the urban-rural gaps in these measures have narrowed as a result of the consolidation, at least in the near term. This surprising result may be partly explained by urban-rural inequality in access to care and provincial fiscal spending on health care. While these findings need to be confirmed with additional data and research, we call for continued efforts on addressing supply-side challenges, particularly in under-served areas.","tags":null,"title":"Social Health Insurance Consolidation and Urban-Rural Inequality in Utilization and Financial Risk Protection in China","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yubraj Archarya","Di Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656374400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656374400,"objectID":"b29c78a192b82249e04cedbd079febab","permalink":"https://www.drdiyang.com/publication/the-effect-of-disability-on-educational-labor-market-and-marital-outcomes-in-a-low-income-context/","publishdate":"2022-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/the-effect-of-disability-on-educational-labor-market-and-marital-outcomes-in-a-low-income-context/","section":"publication","summary":"There is limited evidence from low-income countries on the multifaceted effects of disability on an individual's wellbeing. Using a nationally representative sample of 2.8 million individuals, we documented the association between disability and educational, labor market, and marital outcomes in Nepal. We obtained plausibly causal estimates by comparing these outcomes for siblings living in the same household. Individuals with disability were at a severe disadvantage in almost all of the outcomes we evaluated. Compared to siblings without disability, siblings with disability were 16.5 percentage points less likely to be enrolled in school, 6.9 percentage points less likely to be at the appropriate grade level, and 21.4 percentage points less likely to be employed. Consistent with the prevalent discrimination against girls and stigma on disability, individuals with disability had difficulty getting married, and the adverse effects were more pronounced for girls than for boys.","tags":null,"title":"The Effect of Disability on Educational, Labor Market, and Marital Outcomes in a Low-Income Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yubraj Archarya","Di Yang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613865600,"objectID":"8de1bedc6099540f38c426a4bfee91cd","permalink":"https://www.drdiyang.com/publication/economic-and-social-drivers-of-antibiotic-dispensing-practices-among-community-pharmacies-in-nepal/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/economic-and-social-drivers-of-antibiotic-dispensing-practices-among-community-pharmacies-in-nepal/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Objective To assess economic and social drivers of dispensing antibiotics without prescription by community pharmacies in Nepal. Method A survey was conducted among 111 pharmacy owners and managers in five districts. Information on demographic and economic characteristics of the pharmacies (e.g. revenue and profits from antibiotics) and their inclination to sell antibiotics without a physician?s prescription under various scenarios (e.g. diarrhoea in a child) was collected. Univariate analysis was conducted to assess the demographic and economic characteristics. Bivariate analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between dispensing antibiotics without prescription and economic and social factors. Results Azithromycin and amoxicillin were the most commonly dispensed antibiotics. The proportions of pharmacies reporting that they would ?most likely? or ?likely? dispense antibiotics without prescription to adult patients ranged from 36.9% (sore throat) to 67.6% (cough). The proportions for paediatric patients ranged from 62.2% (sore throat) to 80.2% (cough or diarrhoea). There was no consistent relationship between the likelihood of dispensing antibiotics and revenues, profits or the number of patients. Instead, dispensing behaviour was influenced by the pressure from the patient; the respondents were more likely to dispense antibiotics when the patient specifically asked for ?an antibiotic? rather than for ?a medicine?, and 68.5% respondents ranked ?customer satisfaction? as the most important factor motivating their work. Conclusions In Nepal, inappropriate sale of antibiotics by community pharmacists is high, particularly for paediatric patients. Additional research is needed to establish key drivers of this behaviour and to help design effective approaches to reducing AMR.","tags":null,"title":"Economic and Social Drivers of Antibiotic Dispensing Practices among Community Pharmacies in Nepal","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yubraj Archarya","Di Yang","Andrew D Jones"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1613865600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1613865600,"objectID":"4de7fd27993b4a604f0f9a4b9cbdd4e3","permalink":"https://www.drdiyang.com/publication/livestock-ownership-and-anaemia-in-sub-saharan-african-households/","publishdate":"2021-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/livestock-ownership-and-anaemia-in-sub-saharan-african-households/","section":"publication","summary":"Objective: To determine the association between livestock ownership and Hb con- centration ofwomen of child-bearing age (WCBA) and preschool-aged children in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Design: A prospective analysis of publicly available cross-sectional data, using linear and logistic regressions controlling for potential confounders. Setting: Twenty-eight countries in SSA. Participants: 162 305 WCBA and 118 607 children aged 6–59 months. Results: More than half of WCBA (62.5 %) and children (58 %) belonged to house- holds that owned livestock. The average altitude-adjusted blood Hb concentration for WCBA and children was 12.23 and 10·24 g/dL, respectively. In adjusted models, higher number oflivestock owned was associated with lower Hb concentration for children but not for WCBA. The magnitude of the association for children was small, with one additional unit of livestock owned reducing Hb concentration by 0.001 g/dL. Higher numbers of cattle, cows and bulls, sheep, and goats were associated with lower Hb concentration for both groups. The number of certain categories of livestock owned was associated with the consumption of relevant foods by children. There was no association between the consumption of animal-source foods and Hb concentration or between livestock ownership and diarrhoeal diseases or fever among children. Conclusions: Livestock ownership in SSA had a net negative association with the Hb concentration of children and no association with that of WCBA. The results highlight the need for research aimed at clarifying the mechanisms linking live- stock ownership and nutritional status, and identifying entry points for leveraging livestock ownership to improve the health of women and children in SSA.","tags":null,"title":"Livestock ownership and anaemia in Sub-Saharan African households","type":"publication"}]
