    <p><h2>1.What problem was hypertext proposed to solve?</h2><p>
    <p>According to Tim Berners-Lee(1989), Hypertext was proposed to solve information access and loss in CERN.<p>
    <p>The access to and the flow of information were very inefficient in CERN. As CERN constantly introduced new technology and makes changes, a part of organization was usually influenced. “At this point, one has to dig around to find out what other parts and people will be affected. Keeping a book up to date becomes impractical, and the structure of the book needs to be constantly revised.” (Tim Berners-Lee, March 1989, May 1990, http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html)
<p>
    <p>Also, “The problems of information loss may be particularly acute at CERN” because of “the high turnover of people”. “The technical details of past projects are sometimes lost forever, or only recovered after a detective investigation in an emergency. Often, the information has been recorded, it just cannot be found” (Tim Berners-Lee, March 1989, May 1990, http://www.w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html).

    <p><h2>2. What are local files and web servers? Describe how they work together and they result in?</h2><p>
    <p>Local files are the files stored in local computer system, which are not necessarily accessible through Internet. According to Wikipedia, “A web server is a computer system that processes requests via HTTP.” (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_server). <p>
    <p>Website designer uploads local files stored in his/her computer to the web server connected to Internet, thus these files will be accessible through Internet. When a Internet user visits the website, his/her browser will fetch the files from the web server, interprets them and eventually displays the outcome on his/her screen.<p>
